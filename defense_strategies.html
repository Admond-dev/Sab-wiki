            <p>Your base is only as strong as your Rebirth level. Rebirthing is the primary method for unlocking advanced defensive structures, expanding base capacity, and increasing floor space to protect your most valuable Brainrots.</p>

            <h2>💣 Defensive Traps and Their Costs</h2>
            <p>Traps are your front-line defense. Strategic placement can deter most casual thieves, forcing high-level raiders to waste precious time and health. Traps disappear after one use.</p>

            <h2>🧠 Stealing Strategies: The Raider's Guide</h2>
            <p>The core of the game is competitive. Here are the top 2025 strategies for successful raids and avoiding detection.</p>
            
            <h3>***The Stealing Loop (How it Works)***</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Find an unlocked base with valuable Brainrots.</li>
                <li>Avoid traps and reach the Brainrot's pillar. Stealing it <b>alerts the owner immediately</b>.</li>
                <li>Carry the Brainrot on your back, which <b>massively slows your movement speed</b> and disables item use.</li>
                <li>Run back to your own base's drop-off zone. If you are knocked out by the owner or their traps, the Brainrot drops.</li>
                <li>Successfully drop the Brainrot to claim it permanently.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>***Strategy 1: The Floor Hop Rush***</h3>
            <p>Target bases with high-value units on the <b>Second or Third Floor</b>. Most players rely on floor one traps. Your goal is speed:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Use a <b>Speed Boost</b> or <b>Robux Jump Pack</b> to quickly bypass floor one traps and stairs.</li>
                <li>Focus fire on the closest Brainrot to the drop-off point. *Do not* go for the deepest Brainrot first; prioritize the fastest escape.</li>
                <li><b>Watch the Owner's Icon:</b> If the base owner logs in or clicks the 'Return to Base' button, they will activate the <b>Laser Gate</b>. Steal immediately and run!</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>***Strategy 2: The Distraction Steal***</h3>
            <p>If the target base has a strong Controller or Laser Gate:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Have a low-value <b>"Sacrifice Brainrot"</b> (a Rare or Epic) ready to drop.</li>
                <li>Wait until a high-value Brainrot (Mythic/God) is being carried by the Stealing Cart.</li>
                <li>Steal the sacrifice unit first. This will trigger the Laser Gate/Controller cooldown.</li>
                <li>Immediately steal the high-value unit on its way back to their Brainrot Machine. <b>This is a high-risk, high-reward move!</b></li>
            </ul>
